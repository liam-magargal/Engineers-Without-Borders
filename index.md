# Spring 2019 - Water Tank Sensor System/Outdoor Calinsthenics Gym
  In the spring of my first year, I joined Lehigh University's chapter of the Engineers Without Borders. I was assigned to a project to research a water level sensor for a water tank being designed by the Lehigh Valley Professional Chapter of the Engineers Without Borders in the Dominican Republic. After a few weeks of research, our chapter decided to change our project to focus on assisting the design of a fellow Lehigh student looking to construct an outdoor gym on Bethlehem's Greenway. Through this process, I learned a lot about flexibility and responding to the needs of the community or organization I am working for.
  
# Fall 2019 - Chill Challenge
  In the fall of 2019, our chapter asked for individuals who would write a proposal to respond to the [Chill Challenge](https://www.ewb-usa.org/chill-challenge/). The Chill Challenge was called to attempt to develop affordable off-grid refrigeration for people living in developing countries, who currently have no feasible access to it. After I was given leadership of this group, we began researching efficient cooling mechanisms and suitable power generation methods for the refrigerator. We also began designing a 3D model of the cooling space. Our initial research returned a few options. The most obvious cooling mechanism was vapor compression, which is standard in the overwhelming majority of refrigeration systems. It is very reliable and efficient; however, it often uses refrigerants with high global warming potential. We also came across thermoelectric cooling, an extremely inefficient, but reliable cooling mechanism. For power generation, we researched diesel electric generators, solar panels, and biogas electric generation. Biogas is the gas that can be extracted from animal manure. If properly filtered, it can be converted to natural gas, which can be used in a natural gas electric gernerator. After doing our preliminary research, we prioritized our goals. After some discussion, we decided to focus on ensuring reliability, accessibility, and sustainability. Reliability is essential because of the location that our design would be implemented in. Replacement parts would be difficult to ship in and technicians would likely be difficult to find. Accessibility is an essential piece of the project. The goal of designing this refrigerator is to make refrigeration more accessible to people in rural communities in developing countries. Lastly, the world dramatically changing to emphasize sustainability. The Engineers Without Borders were set on only choosing proposals that were sustainable. As a result, we wanted these refrigerators to be healthy and sustainable for a long time. After some further discussion, we settled on using vapor compression cooling, emphasizing that we will use hydrocarbon refrigerants with low global warming potential. To power the device, we decided to use biogas to generate electricity. Farm animals are a central piece of communities in developing countries and produce large amounts of waste. The waste is abundant in energy and, under the right conditions, could make a perfect solution to the problem of off-grid refrigeration. The Engineers Without Borders will review all submitted proposals, and pick up to ten groups to give grant money to develop working prototypes for their design. We will likely hear back in early February of 2020 if our design has been chosen.
