# Spring 2019 - Water Tank Sensor System/Outdoor Calinsthenics Gym
  In the spring of my first year, I joined Lehigh University's chapter of the Engineers Without Borders. I was assigned to a project to research a water level sensor for a water tank being designed by the Lehigh Valley Professional Chapter of the Engineers Without Borders in the Dominican Republic. 

Hi Ashley I love you
